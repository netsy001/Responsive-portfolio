                        internationally in all formats of the game. An all-rounder who bats left-handed in the middle

                        Punjabi actor Yograj Singh. One of the greatest limited over players to play for India, Yuvraj
                        was particularly noted for his aggressive stroke play of the ball and his fielding. </p>
