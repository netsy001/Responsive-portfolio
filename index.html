                        internationally in all formats of the game. An all-rounder who bats left-handed in the middle
                        order and bowls slow left-arm orthodox, Yuvraj is the son of former Indian fast bowler and
                        Punjabi actor Yograj Singh. One of the greatest limited over players to play for India, Yuvraj
                        was particularly noted for his aggressive stroke play of the ball and his fielding. <br>

                    <p class="font-weight-light">In 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his left lung
                        and underwent chemotherapy treatment in Boston and Indianapolis. In March 2012, he was
                        discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and
                        returned to India in April. He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September
                        against New Zealand shortly before the 2012 World Twenty20.</p>
                    <p>In 2012, Yuvraj was conferred with the Arjuna Award, India's second highest sporting award by the
                        Government of India. In 2014, he was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian
                        honour. At the 2014 IPL auction Royal Challengers Bangalore bought Yuvraj for an all-time high
                        price of ₹14 crore and, in 2015, the Delhi Daredevils bought him for ₹16 crore making him the
                        most expensive player ever to be sold in the IPL.</p>
                    <p> On 10 June 2019, Yuvraj announced his retirement from all forms of International cricket. He
                        last represented India in June 2017</p>
