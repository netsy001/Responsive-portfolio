                        and volleyball.
                        In my year 11 and year 12 I played lot of volleyball and represented as a captian for my school
                        team. Later when am studying engineering i played lot of cricket and am one of the team member
                        of our Mechanical branch team. Now, after coming to Australia am playing cricket for ATCA club
                        and also a member of TASA team.

                    <p>Everyday i will try to learn something new. I never get tired or feel bored.
                        I like to keep myself busy doing something, learning something or atleast keep myself busy
                        watching a documentry. Am inspired a lot from the life of Yuvraj Singh who is former Cricket
                        player who survived cancer and played cricket for India. Not just Yuvi there are many more people
                        in life who inspired me. </p>
                    <p class="index"> I have Analyised myself if I can do this program before enrolling for a bootcamp program.
                        The answer is yes. Now, spending time and working towards my goal. Yes, i will make it. God did
                        not bring me this long to leave me alone.</p>
